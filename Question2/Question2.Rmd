## Context for less avid listeners: 
Metallica is a pioneering American heavy metal band known for fast tempo's, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship. Their breakthrough came with their 3rd album: 'Master of Puppets' (1986), described as one of the heaviest metal albums and named their best work.'...And Justice for All' (1988) earned their first Grammy nod, while Metallica (1991) marked a mainstream shift from their thrash metal roots, becoming their best-selling album (16M+ U.S. copies). After genre experimentation, they returned to thrash with 'Death Magnetic' (2008). Their latest release is '72 Seasons' (2023) [@wiki:metallica]. 

Coldplay, a British rock band renowned for their live performances, have sold over 100 million albums worldwide. Their debut album, 'Parachutes' (2000), featuring "Yellow," won a Brit Award and a Grammy. The follow-up, 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' (2002), repeated this success, while 'X&Y' (2005) completed what they called a trilogy. 'Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends' (2008) also earned a Grammy, topping charts in over 30 countries. Later albums, 'Mylo Xyloto' (2011), 'Ghost Stories' (2014), 'A Head Full of Dreams' (2015), 'Everyday Life' (2019), 'Music of the Spheres' (2021), and 'Moon Music' (2024), explored genres like electronica, R&B, disco, and progressive rock [@wiki:coldplay].

**Consistent Popularity, Divergent Paths**  
Both Coldplay and Metallica have maintained remarkable popularity throughout their careers as A-list artists. However, our analysis reveals that **Coldplay achieved higher average popularity** overall, while Metallica's success stemmed from a more consistent musical formula.  

**Metallica: The Power of Consistency**  
Metallica's music shows exceptionally low variation in key metrics:  
- Tempo (BPM)  
- Energy  
- Danceability  
- Acousticness  

The minimal standard deviations in these metrics suggest a deliberate adherence to their signature sound over time, with little experimentation across albums.  

**Coldplay: Embracing Musical Evolution**  
In contrast, Coldplay exhibits:  
- Higher variability in acousticness and energy  
- Significant deviations between songs, indicating willingness to experiment  
- Potential album-driven shifts in style  

This analysis sets the stage for deeper investigation into how these contrasting approaches have sustained two of music's most enduring acts. Might these differences be tied to specific album releases? Lets find out...  

# Comparing Characteristics

```{r stacked bar graph, fig.height=10, fig.width=8}

# Prepare data 
df_stack <- df_metcol_unique %>% 
  filter(band %in% c("Coldplay", "Metallica")) %>%
  group_by(band, month_year) %>%
  summarise(
    ave_popularity = mean(popularity, na.rm = TRUE),
    ave_energy = mean(energy, na.rm = TRUE),
    ave_danceability = mean(danceability, na.rm = TRUE),
    ave_acousticness = mean(acousticness, na.rm = TRUE),
    ave_tempo = mean(tempo, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("ave"),
    names_to = "category",
    values_to = "value"
  )

df_stack$month_year <- as.Date(paste(df_stack$month_year, "01", sep = "-"))

df_stack %>%
  filter(month_year > as.Date("1995-01-01")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month_year, y = value, fill = band)) +
  geom_area(position = "stack", alpha = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~ category, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    labs(title = "Figure 1: Stacked Bar Graph of Band Characteristics Over time", x = "", y = "Count", fill = "")

```

The stacked bar graph visualization highlights key stylistic differences between Coldplay and Metallica, with distinct color coding (green for Coldplay, orange for Metallica) facilitating immediate comparison.

Coldplay's Signature Sound
* Higher acousticness: Prominent use of organic instrumentation
* Elevated danceability: Rhythmic patterns conducive to movement
* Greater popularity: Broader mainstream appeal

Metallica's Dominant Traits
* Intense energy: Characteristic high-intensity sound
* Consistent heaviness: Lower variability in energy metrics

Coldplay's fluid, evolving style contrasts sharply with Metallica's steadfast intensity, reflecting divergent artistic philosophies. This visualization underscores how these differences manifest in measurable audio features.

```{r}

table_best_albums 

```

Table 2 above depicts the most popular albums for both Coldplay and Metallica. It is interesting to note that Metallica achieves higher popularity in each of their top 3 albums (quite significantly so for the second place album) in comparison to Coldplay despite Table 1 depicting that Coldplay outscored Metallica in average popularity by quite a long shot. We also note that Coldplay's top 3 albums portray higher variance in acousticness again portraying the band's willingness to sample different music styles that win over more listeners. 

# Conclusion
This analysis reveals two distinct musical trajectories. Coldplay demonstrates greater variability in popularity and a penchant for stylistic experimentation, while Metallica maintains remarkable consistency in both appeal and sound. These contrasting approaches underscore the unique artistic identities that have sustained both bands as iconic acts. The findings illuminate how adaptability and consistency can each forge enduring musical legacies.
