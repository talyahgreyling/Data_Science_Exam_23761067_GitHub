<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos = 'H')

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

You are welcome to add some sort of an introduction here. Spend 5 minutes detailing the purpose here, e.g.

Look at the README.txt file and maybe give some background - especially also in understanding the definition of the variables.

Notice that for the below plots I created a parameters to play around with xaxis labels.

# Time time-series representation of the rank-correlation calculations 
```{r}
# Data wrangling 
top_names <- Baby_names %>% 
  top_n_names(n = 25)

# Computing Spearman Rank Correlation for a specific target year
SpearCorr <- calculate_correlations(top_names, target_year = 2000, future_years = 3)

# Apply Correlation calculation to all years
corr_results <- name_persistence(top_names, future_years = 3)

```

# Time time-series representation of the rank-correlation visualisation
```{r, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Persistence of National Top 25 Baby Names (1910-2014).\\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10}

PersistPlot <- plot_name_persistence(corr_results = corr_results) 
PersistPlot

```
As you can see from Figure \ref{Figure1}, name persistence is much stronger among names for boys than names for girls. Both display trends that appear to be generally downward sloping over time. Persistence is also seen to decrease the further the future year is from the target year. Considering the client's suspicion that popular name trends have been slower to persist since the 1990s than in earlier decades their suspicion is correct for boys names, but appears to be the opposite for girls names which display with an upwards trend since the 1990s. 

\newpage 

# Popular names per decade calculations
```{r}
pop_names <- Baby_names %>% 
  top_n_names(n = 10)

decade_top_names <- top_n_names_per_decade(pop_names, top_n = 10)   
```

# Popular names per decade visualisation 
```{r, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Persistence of National Top 10 Baby Names per decade (1910-2014).\\label{Figure2}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 20, fig.width = 10}

PopNamesMap <- popular_names_heatmap(decade_top_names)
PopNamesMap

```

Figure \ref{Figure2} once again shows that name persistence is much stronger among males. By displaying the information in a heatmap we can see that popularity is concentrated among less names for males than for females, contributing to their higher persistence levels.  

\newpage 

# Movie star names calculations 
```{r}
# Create a data frame of popular movies 
Popular_movies <- get_popular_movies(HBO_credits, HBO_titles)
Popular_movies 

# See if the top 10 baby names per decade are related to actors/ actresses' names from popular movies released during that decade: 

babies_after_actors <- left_join(Popular_movies, decade_top_names, by = "Name") %>% # create single data frame
    drop_na(Total_Dec_Count) %>% # filter out instances where actor name was not a popular baby name in that decade 
    filter(!(release_year > (Decade + 10))) 

top_10_female <- babies_after_actors %>%
    filter(Gender == "F") %>%
    arrange(desc(Total_Dec_Count)) %>%
    slice_head(n = 10)

top_10_male <- babies_after_actors %>%
  filter(Gender == "M") %>%               
  arrange(desc(Total_Dec_Count)) %>% 
    slice_head(n = 10)
    
top_10_female
top_10_female

```
