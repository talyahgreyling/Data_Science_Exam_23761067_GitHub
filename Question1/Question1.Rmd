<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos = 'H')

if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

Look at the README.txt file and maybe give some background - especially also in understanding the definition of the variables.

Notice that for the below plots I created a parameters to play around with xaxis labels.
